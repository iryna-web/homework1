  <p>We calculate the deadline from the minute we receive your payment. The writer we allocate will only begin conducting research after your payment has been received. We guarantee a full refund, which means we will give you your money back if you are in any way dissatisfied with the service you receive. We may ask you for identification verification. This is our method of ensuring you are actually the person who ordered the paper.</p>

          <p>You can send messages to your writer if you have any queries and he/she will be on hand to respond to you via the same channel. You may update the information you originally provided, but if you make changes to the instructions, the size of your assignment, the service level, the deadline or the type of paper, you may be asked to pay an additional fee to allow us to handle your new requirements. Don't panic if you don't receive an immediate response from your writer. They may not check their messages continuously, but they will be working on your paper.</p>
